# neXtProt feature viewer

> The feature viewer is a super easy javascript library to use in order to draw the different features covering a sequence for a better visualization.

**Live demo** : https://cdn.rawgit.com/calipho-sib/feature-viewer/v0.1.44/examples/index.html

## Getting Started

**1.** You can get the library in your project using bower or npm
```
//BOWER//
bower install feature-viewer

//NODE//
npm install feature-viewer
```

Or Include the feature-viewer **JS** and **CSS** from rawgit CDN in the header of your html
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/calipho-sib/feature-viewer/v0.1.44/dist/feature-viewer.min.css">

<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/calipho-sib/feature-viewer/v0.1.44/dist/feature-viewer.bundle.js"></script>
```

**NOTE** : If you already got the dependencies (D3, Bootstrap & Jquery) in your project, use the simple minified version instead of the bundle :
```html
<script src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/calipho-sib/feature-viewer/v0.1.44/dist/feature-viewer.min.js"></script>
```

**2.** Specify a div in your html
```
<div id="fv1"></div>
```

**3.** Create an instance of FeatureViewer in javascript with the sequence (or a length), the div in which it will be display and the rendering options of your choice.
```javascript
//For Node add before : var FeatureViewer = require("feature-viewer");

var ft = new FeatureViewer('MALWMRLLPLLALLALWGPGPGAGSLQPLALEGSLQKRGIVEQCCTSICSLYQLE',
                           '#fv1',
                            {
                                showAxis: true,
                                showSequence: true,
                                brushActive: true, //zoom
                                toolbar:true, //current zoom & mouse position
                                bubbleHelp:true, 
                                zoomMax:50 //define the maximum range of the zoom
                            });
                            
//Instead of a sequence, you can also initialize the feature viewer with a length (integer) :
var ft = new FeatureViewer(213,'#fv1');
```

**4.** Finally, add the features
   ```javascript
ft.addFeature({
       data: [{x:20,y:32},{x:46,y:100},{x:123,y:167}],
       name: "test feature 1",
       className: "test1", //can be used for styling
       color: "#0F8292",
       type: "rect" // ['rect', 'path', 'line']
   });
   ```
   
**5.** Et voila!

## Functionalities

* Zoom into the Feature-viewer by selecting a part of the sequence with your mouse. Zoom out with a right-click.    
You can also zoom programmatically with the methods **```zoom(start,end)```** and **```resetZoom()```**


* A tooltip appears when the mouse is over a feature, giving its exact positions, and optionally, a description.
 
 
* beside the positions for each element, you can also give a description & an ID, allowing you to link click event on the feature to the rest of your project.

## Options

* Show axis
* Show sequence
* Brush active (zoom)
* Toolbar (current zoom & position)
* Bubble help 
* Zoom max
* Features height
* Offset

## ClearInstance()

You may sometimes want to reload your feature-viewer with new parameters. To avoid memory leaks, the method **```clearInstance()```** will clear each element & listener for you before you delete the feature-viewer instance.

## Use it with NeXtProt API

<img src="/assets/FVDemo.png" width="100%" />

It is possible to fill the feature viewer with protein features from [NeXtProt](https://search.nextprot.org/), the human protein database.   

- First, find your protein of interest in NeXtProt and get the neXtProt accession (NX_...). (You can find your protein by entering an accession number of another database, like UniProt or Ensembl)   
- Then, check the type of feature in the [NeXtProt API](https://api.nextprot.org/) that you would like to add to your viewer. For example, "propeptide" or "mature-protein".
- Include the feature viewer bundle with nextprot to your html  : feature-viewer.nextprot.js
- Finally, create your feature-viewer like this :

```javascript
//initalize nextprot Client
var applicationName = 'demo app'; //please provide a name for your application
var clientInfo='calipho group at sib'; //please provide some information about you
var nx = new Nextprot.Client(applicationName, clientInfo);
        
//var entry = "NX_P01308";
var isoform = "NX_P01308-1";

// feature viewer options
var options = {showAxis: true, showSequence: true,
brushActive: true, toolbar:true,
bubbleHelp: true, zoomMax:20 };

// Create nextprot feature viewer
nxFeatureViewer(nx, isoform, "#div2", options).then(function(ff){
// Add first custom feature
ff.addFeature({
    data: [{x:20,y:32},{x:46,y:100},{x:123,y:167}],
    name: "test feature 1",
    className: "test1",
    color: "#0F8292",
    type: "rect",
    filter: "type1"
});
// Add second feature from nextprot
var styles = [
    {name: "Propeptide",className: "pro",color: "#B3B3B3",type: "rect",filter:"Processing"}, 
    {name: "Mature protein",className: "mat",color: "#B3B3C2",type: "rect",filter:"Processing"}
 ]; 
ff.addNxFeature(["propeptide","mature-protein"], styles);

```
